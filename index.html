			<div class="grid-item skill"><h2>Innovation</h2></div>
			<div class="grid-item skill"><h2>Perseverance</h2></div>
			<div class="grid-item"><p class="elaboration">Leadership in business is the capacity of a company's management to set and achieve challenging goals, take fast and decisive action when needed, outperform the competition, and inspire others to perform at the highest level they can.
			<br><br>
			It can be difficult to place a value on leadership or other qualitative aspects of a company, versus quantitative metrics that are commonly tracked and much easier to compare between companies. Leadership can also speak to a more holistic approach, as in the tone a company's management sets or the culture of the company that management establishes.</p></div>
			<div class="grid-item"><p class="elaboration">Innovation, as a concept, refers to the process that an individual or organization undertakes to conceptualize brand new products, processes, and ideas, or to approach existing products, processes, and ideas in new ways. 
			<br><br>
			In the world of business, there are many different types of innovation that a company might pursue. These are often tied directly to individual products, internal processes or workflows, or business models. Some companies even embrace all three in an effort to spearhead growth while adapting to the ever-changing market.</p></div>
			<div class="grid-item"><p class="elaboration">We've all heard of the "fight or flight" response. There's a third F-word (no, not that one) that often accompanies career fear: "freeze."<br><br>
			When faced with an uncertain future, many people choose to do nothing. They worry and whittle away time on meaningless make-work. They'll tell everyone about their great plans, but will spin and spit and do almost anything other than take positive steps to move their lives forward.
			<br><br>
			The simple truth is that every monumental endeavor can only be achieved in increments. In business, perseverance means leaning forward, walking one foot after the other into the chill entrepreneurial wind until you've reached your milestones and eventually achieved your goal.</p></div>
